# Full Neon Agent SDLC Wrapper Report

- Success: **True**
- Stop reason: `all_hard_criteria_passed`
- Outer rounds: 1
- Duration: 0.0s
- Project: `D:\neon_unified\oiioii_clone`

## Goal

Build an AI animation agent platform (oiioii-style) with full engineering surface: auth, projects, creative workflow orchestration (script → character → scene → storyboard → render → sound), job system, asset store, MediaGenerationService using API keys from env, workflow/jobs/assets APIs, and a polished workspace UI with agent timeline and asset gallery. Handle media failures as structured job failures.
